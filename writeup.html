    <h1>Writeup</h1>

    <h3>What have you done so far?</h3>
    <p>So far, we have implemented a rough draft of the Stroop test portion of our project, which aims to engage the users more since our datasetâ€™s participants went through a Stroop test as part of the experiment. We believe that starting with the users doing a Stroop test themselves would make them more curious to explore the data, as the participants in our dataset went through the same test in a similar format. As a result, the users are more likely to spend more time understanding and observing potential patterns in the data once they move on to the next portion of the project, the interactive visualizations.
        For the second portion of our project, so far, we have developed one interactive visualization with one interactive element. So far, we have a visualization with a working tooltip that helps the user learn more about each point. We have also added drop-down lists, but they are not functional yet. Moving forward, we plan to enhance both portions of our project. First, for the Stroop test part, we plan to refine the Stroop test further and make it as smooth and engaging of an experience for the user as possible. Second, for the interactive visualizations, we plan to expand our visualizations to cover as much of the data as we see fit and incorporate more interactive features to enhance user engagement and data exploration.</p>
    <h3>What will be the most challenging of your project to design and why?</h3> 
    <p>We believe the most challenging part of our project design would be implementing the scrollytelling aspect. After completing the Stroop test, the users will be directed to a home page structured as a guided narrative experience. At first, the page will briefly describe the dataset, then the user scrolls through to get an in-depth look at each of the three wearables our dataset includes. The design would be that once the user scrolls past the initial dataset description, they would see on their left a brief description of the current wearable and on the right an interactive visualization for that wearable with a drop-down list to switch between the different physiological signals. Then, the user would keep scrolling and see the same format for the other wearables. We might change the format from left-right to top-bottom if the visualizations are too small.
        Moreover, we anticipate the most challenging part of our design to be ensuring a smooth and engaging transition between sections while maintaining the full functionality of each section. Scrolling needs to feel smooth and natural, without abrupt jumps. So, we believe fitting the writings and visualizations on the home page and allowing the user to scroll through them smoothly while maintaining full functionality would be the most challenging part of our design.</p>
