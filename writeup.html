    <h3>What have you done so far?</h3>
    <p>We believe the most challenging part of our project design would be implementing the scrollytelling aspect. After completing the Stroop test, the users will be directed to a home page structured as a guided narrative experience. At first, the page will briefly describe the dataset, then the user scrolls through to get an in-depth look at each of the three wearables our dataset includes. The design would be that once the user scrolls past the initial dataset description, they would see on their left a brief description of the current wearable and on the right an interactive visualization for that wearable with a drop-down list to switch between the different physiological signals. Then, the user would keep scrolling and see the same format for the other wearables. We might change the format from left-right to top-bottom if the visualizations are too small.
        Moreover, we anticipate the most challenging part of our design to be ensuring a smooth and engaging transition between sections while maintaining the full functionality of each section. Scrolling needs to feel smooth and natural, without abrupt jumps. So, we believe fitting the writings and visualizations on the home page and allowing the user to scroll through them smoothly while maintaining full functionality would be the most challenging part of our design.</p>
